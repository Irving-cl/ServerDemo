# ServerDemo
Let's make a toy server to learn something about socket.

I really want to get a job of developing server programs. So I need to learn a lot, including networking protocol, operating system and so on. However, it's dull studying them solely from books. So I decided to make toy server. Hope it will help me to take better command of these things.
